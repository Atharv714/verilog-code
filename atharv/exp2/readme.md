## Title of the Experiment:
​
To design and Implement adder and subtractor using Verilog code and Verify output waveform (or) Response  with respective truth tables.
​
## Objective/Motivation :
​
In this lab, a half adder, full adder, half subtractor and full subtractor are designed. The objective will be to test these designs on Xilinx simulation tool. The tests will be performed for all the possible combinations of inputs to verify their functionality. Moreover, the knowledge gained will be used to design much larger and complex logic designs.
​
### Result 
​
Result: The simulation waveforms are obtained with various input combination of binary data and verified with the expected waveforms.
